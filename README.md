# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> Outline a brief description of your project.


## General Information
* To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
* using neural network
* The problem of overfitting can be solved by add more layer,neurons or adding dropout layers.
